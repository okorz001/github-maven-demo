# github-maven-demo

Demonstration of GitHub Actions, Packages, and Pages with Maven Project

## Features

* Builds every PR and every commit to master
* Manual release from master
  * Publish to GitHub Packages
  * Publish site to GitHub Pages
* Cache maven repository between builds

Both the library and site are intentionally trivial to avoid obfuscating the important parts.
